[![Language Agnostic](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-agnostic-success)](#)
[![Security Warning](https://img.shields.io/badge/SECURITY-Review%20AGENT.md%20before%20use-critical)](#security-warning)

> Drop this into any **repo or local workspace** to standardize how AI agents (Claude, GPT, etc.) behave when proposing commands or automations. Works across Windows/macOS/Linux, any runtime or package manager. No Git host required.

> üö® **General Warning:** Treat any `AGENT.md` as executable policy. Verify source, read it fully, pin to a commit, and test in a sandbox. Beware of auto-run, networked tests, data exfiltration, Git hook changes, and destructive deletes.

## ‚ú® What is this?

`T10 Agents Policy` is a small, public specification (the `AGENT.md` file) you can add to your repositories **or local workspaces/codebases**. It defines:

* A consistent agent configuration (OS, shell, path style, terminal)
* A mandatory **Adapter Matrix** that maps abstract operations ‚Üí concrete commands per shell
* Cross‚Äërepo **No‚ÄëExecute** safety rules
* A strict **Approval** workflow with one‚Äëtime codes before any execution of user code
* A copy‚Äëpaste **Run Plan** template agents must output before running anything

The result: agents stay deterministic, shell‚Äëaware, and safe‚Äîwithout you having to rewrite guidance per project.

---

## üöÄ Quick start

1. **Copy** [`AGENT.md`](./AGENT.md) to the root of your repo **or** local workspace.
2. **Edit** the `Configuration (edit me)` block at the top to match your environment:

   ```yaml
   agent:
     os: windows            # windows | linux | macos
     shell: cmd             # cmd | powershell | bash | zsh | fish
     terminal: vscode       # optional: vscode | system | wsl | git-bash | cygwin | msys2
     path_style: windows    # windows (\\) | posix (/)
     use_wsl: false         # if true, treat shell as bash in WSL regardless of OS
   ```
3. **If you use version control, commit it.** Otherwise just keep `AGENT.md` in your workspace root. Agents should read and honor `AGENT.md` automatically when acting on your repo or local workspace.
4. (Optional) Add **guardrails** (local hook or any CI) from the section below.

---

## üß≠ How agents should use this

Agents MUST:

* Read `AGENT.md` **before** proposing commands or emitting a **Run Plan**
* Translate abstract ops to concrete commands using the **Adapter Matrix** for the configured `os`+`shell`
* Prefer script shims (e.g., `npm run`) over direct binaries to stay cross‚Äëplatform
* Follow the **No‚ÄëExecute Policy** and **Approval Code** workflow below

Recommended snippets to paste into your agent setup or task description:

> "This workspace (repo or local) includes `AGENT.md`. You MUST read and follow it."

> "This workspace (repo or local) includes `AGENT.md`. You MUST read and follow it. When proposing commands, use the configured `os`/`shell`, map abstract ops via the Adapter Matrix, and do not execute user code without an approved Run Plan and 6‚Äëdigit code."

---

## üß© Adapter Matrix (snapshot)

**Abstract ops**

* `MKDIR_RECURSIVE <dir>` ‚Äì create directory, creating parents if needed
* `RM_RECURSIVE_FORCE <path>` ‚Äì delete file/dir tree without prompts
* `COPY_RECURSIVE <src> <dst>` ‚Äì copy files/dirs recursively, overwrite
* `MOVE_FORCE <src> <dst>` ‚Äì move/rename, overwrite
* `LIST_ALL [dir]` ‚Äì list files including hidden
* `SET_ENV <NAME> <VALUE>` ‚Äì set env var for current process

**Concrete commands** (see `AGENT.md` for the full table and notes)

| Abstract                     | bash/zsh/fish (Linux/macOS) | PowerShell                                               | cmd.exe                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MKDIR_RECURSIVE <dir>`      | `mkdir -p "<dir>"`          | `New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "<dir>"`      | `mkdir "<dir>"`                                             |
| `RM_RECURSIVE_FORCE <path>`  | `rm -rf "<path>"`           | `Remove-Item "<path>" -Recurse -Force`                   | `rmdir /s /q "<path>"` (dirs), `del /f /q "<path>"` (files) |
| `COPY_RECURSIVE <src> <dst>` | `cp -r "<src>" "<dst>"`     | `Copy-Item "<src>" -Destination "<dst>" -Recurse -Force` | `xcopy "<src>" "<dst>" /E /I /Y`                            |
| `MOVE_FORCE <src> <dst>`     | `mv -f "<src>" "<dst>"`     | `Move-Item "<src>" "<dst>" -Force`                       | `move /Y "<src>" "<dst>"`                                   |
| `LIST_ALL [dir]`             | `ls -la ["<dir>"]`          | `Get-ChildItem -Force ["<dir>"]`                         | `dir ["<dir>"] /a`                                          |
| `SET_ENV <NAME> <VALUE>`     | `export <NAME>="<VALUE>"`   | `$env:<NAME> = "<VALUE>"`                                | `set <NAME>=<VALUE>`                                        |

> **Windows note:** For `cmd.exe` do **not** use POSIX flags like `-p`. `mkdir` already creates intermediate directories.

## üõ°Ô∏è No‚ÄëExecute Policy (language‚Äëagnostic)

You may build/compile/lint/format/generate docs **without approval** to surface errors.

**Allowed without approval**

* Build/compile, lint/static analysis, format, docs
* Dependency resolution/lockfile updates
* **Unit tests** that run locally with **no external services/network** and no destructive side effects (or compilation‚Äëonly modes like `cargo test --no-run`)

**Requires approval (execution of user code)**

* Any `run/serve/start/exec/bench` command (e.g., `npm run start`, `cargo run`, `go run`, `dotnet run`)
* Launching interpreters with project scripts (`python script.py`, `node app.js`)
* Executing built binaries from `target/`, `bin/`, `dist/`
* Starting servers, watchers, containers/VMs/DBs

When execution is requested, **do not run**. Instead, emit a **Run Plan** and wait for approval.

---

## ‚úÖ Approval workflow

Agents must output the **Run Plan** template **verbatim** (with a fresh random code):

```
* **Command:** `<exact command to run>`
* **Working Directory:** `<absolute or repo/project-relative path>`
* **Expected Side Effects:** `<files created/modified, ports opened, env vars, resource usage>`
* **Stop Method:** `<ctrl-c, kill PID, docker stop, test timeout, etc.>`
* **Logging Path:** `./_runlogs/<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>.log`
* **Approval Code:** `123456`
```

**Rules for approval codes**

* One‚Äëtime use, valid for **10 minutes** or **until the next user message** (whichever comes first)
* **Acceptance formats:** a line containing **only** the 6 digits (whitespace allowed), or the exact phrase `APPROVE RUN: <code>`
* Digits must match the **last issued code**
* Up to **3 mismatches** allowed; on mismatch/expiration: abort and re‚Äëissue a new code with the Run Plan
* **Record** the issued code and the user‚Äôs confirmation in `./_agentlog/`

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Example usage

**Scenario:** Build and test a Node.js project on Windows with `cmd.exe`.

* Allowed without approval: `npm ci`, `npm run build`, `npm test` (if local, no network/services)
* Requires approval: `npm run start`

**Run Plan (example):**

```
* **Command:** npm run start
* **Working Directory:** .\
* **Expected Side Effects:** starts local dev server on port 5173; writes logs to .\_runlogs; reads .env.local
* **Stop Method:** ctrl-c in the terminal
* **Logging Path:** .\_runlogs\20250115-141230.log
* **Approval Code:** 829461
```

## üè† Local machine usage (no repo required)

You can use `AGENT.md` in a plain folder on an end‚Äëuser PC without any Git hosting or CI:

1. Place `AGENT.md` in the **workspace root**.
2. Ensure your agent is pointed at that folder. Most agents read repo/workspace files automatically.
3. The policy‚Äôs paths (e.g., `./_agentlog/`, `./_runlogs/`) are **relative to the workspace root** and will be created on demand.
4. Use the **Adapter Matrix** to keep commands shell‚Äëcorrect on that machine (Windows `cmd`, PowerShell, bash, etc.).

---

## üîß Guardrails (local or any CI) to require `AGENT.md`

Use one of these lightweight checks to ensure `AGENT.md` exists and is versioned.

**Bash (macOS/Linux)**

```bash
# scripts/check-agent-policy.sh
set -euo pipefail
test -f AGENT.md
grep -E "^# AGENT.md ‚Äî T10 Agents Policy \(version [0-9]+\)" AGENT.md
```

**PowerShell (Windows)**

```powershell
# scripts/check-agent-policy.ps1
$ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"
if (-not (Test-Path -Path "AGENT.md")) { throw "AGENT.md missing" }
Select-String -Path "AGENT.md" -Pattern "^# AGENT.md ‚Äî T10 Agents Policy \(version [0-9]+\)" | Out-Null
```

**Pre-commit hook (any VCS, optional)**

```bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -e
test -f AGENT.md
grep -Eq "^# AGENT.md ‚Äî T10 Agents Policy \(version [0-9]+\)" AGENT.md || { echo "AGENT.md missing or malformed"; exit 1; }
```

**Bring-your-own CI**
Run one of the scripts above in your CI of choice (GitLab CI, Jenkins, Azure Pipelines, etc.).

‚îî‚îÄ scripts/               # Optional local guard scripts
```

---

## üîÑ Versioning

* The policy is versioned inside `AGENT.md` header, e.g., `version 1.0.0`.
* Use SemVer for repository tags (`v1.0.0`).
* If you change semantics, bump the policy version and summarize changes in **Changelog**.

---

## üß™ Compatibility

The policy is agent‚Äëagnostic. It has been designed to work with tools that can read repo files and follow instructions, including (non‚Äëexhaustive): Claude, GPT‚Äëbased agents, local LLM assistants, and CI ‚Äúbots.‚Äù

---

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Why a separate `AGENT.md` instead of more prompts?**
It lives with the code. If you use a repo, it‚Äôs reviewable via PRs; if you‚Äôre local‚Äëonly, you can still enforce it with a simple script or pre‚Äëcommit hook. Prompts drift; files persist.

**Will this break on Windows?**
No‚Äîthe Adapter Matrix drives concrete commands for `cmd.exe` and PowerShell. The Windows note forbids POSIX‚Äëonly flags on `cmd.exe`.

**Do I have to use the matrix?**
Yes‚Äîagents MUST translate abstract ops to the configured shell before emitting commands.

**Can agents ever execute without approval?**
Only non‚Äëexecuting actions and strictly local unit tests per the No‚ÄëExecute Policy.

---

## ü§ù Contributing

Issues and PRs welcome! Please:

* Keep examples shell‚Äëaccurate per the Adapter Matrix
* Add tests or CI checks when changing policy semantics
* Update the **Changelog** and bump the policy version when necessary
